## About
Bakdooro is a modern, open-source and efficient backdoor for Minecraft servers written using the Spigot API, created by @AcaiBerii, @Unknown-User2 and @Errorcrafter. We aim to surpass other paid and outdated backdoors such as Qlutch in terms of usability and features. With an easy-to-use console client and a robust API, Bakdooro allows you to directly connect to and run commands on your target server with ease.
